# Personality Classification with K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) Algorithm

A Python assignment that I did while learning ML. In this assignment, I used numpy and pandas to implement KNN algorithm to classify the personality of a person based on the given data.

## Dataset

Dataset is given in the file `16P.csv` which can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anshulmehtakaggl/60k-responses-of-16-personalities-test-mbt). It contains 59999 rows and 62 columns. Each row represents a person and each column represents a question. The first column is the identifier, the last column is the personality type and the rest of the columns are the answers to the questions. The answers are in the range between -3 to 3. The personality types are MBTI types, which are 4 letter codes. For example, the first person in the dataset has the personality type `ENFP`.
